# ðŸ”° Beginner dotfiles template

This repo is mostly for beginners who want to start with some good default dotfiles. Just look how many there are [here on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=dotfiles&type=repositories). See my book [*Terminal Velocity*](https://rwxrob.github.io/books/terminal-velocity) for help getting started and a description of how this repo is organized and what it expects. ***Do not run any `setup` scripts here until you understand what they do. They are destructive.***
