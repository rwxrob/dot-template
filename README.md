# ðŸ”° Beginner dotfiles, installers, and scripts template

***CAUTION: Do not run any `config` or `install` scripts here until you understand what they do. They are destructive.***

This repo is mostly for beginners who want to start with a decent default dotfiles repo and some scripts. There's plenty of [others](https://github.com/search?q=dotfiles&type=repositories) out there as well. Read my book [*Terminal Velocity*](https://rwxrob.github.io/books/terminal-velocity) for help getting started including a description of how this repo is organized and what is expected.
